## Solutions for Quiz One

1. Question One (1) Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory - soln1.c

2. Question Two (2) - Rotate Array Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative - soln2.c

3. Question Three (3) - Contains Duplicate Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct - soln3.c

4. Question Four (4) - Single Number Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one - soln4.c
